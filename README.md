# Optimal Subsampling Design for Polynomial Regression in one Covariate
Accompanying R Scripts to the paper "Optimal Subsampling Design for Polynomial Regression in one Covariate".
Authors: Torsten Reuter and Rainer Schwabe

This repository contains R Scripts for the following parts of the paper. 
Including generating all plots and values in the tables.
<ul>
  <li>Example 4.2 (linear regression for a Exp(1) distributed covariate)</li>
  <li>Example 5.1 (quadratic regression for a standard normal covariate)</li>
  <li>Example 5.3 (quadratic regression for a uniform covariate)</li>
  <li>Example 5.5 (quadratic regression for a t-distributed covariate)</li>
  <li>Table 6 and Figure 6 (efficiencies of uniform random subsampling and an IBOSS-like Design in various settings)</li>
</ul>

It also includes an R Shiny App which visualizes the D-optimal subsampling design for quadratic regression given a t-distributed covariate for various degrees of freedom and the whole range of the subsampling proportion.
